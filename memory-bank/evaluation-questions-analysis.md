## Question Design Principles

1. **Open-ended style**: Questions don't explicitly mention "neuroscience AND philosophy" - they ask broadly, testing if RAG finds cross-domain content
2. **Comprehensive ground truth**: Each question will have paragraph-length reference answers
3. **Multi-book retrieval**: Each question should require content from 4-6 books
4. **Nuanced complexity**: Questions require synthesizing multiple perspectives, not single-chunk answers

## Your Feedback Needed

Please review the 15 proposed topics above and let me know:
- Which topics to **remove** (if any)
- Which topics to **add** from the "Additional Potential Topics" section
- Any **custom topics** you want included
- Any other modifications

The goal is 15 questions that thoroughly test retrieval across the full breadth of your book corpus.
