# RAG1 Mini - Neuro-Philosophy Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

RAG1 Mini creates a unique fusion of disciplines: a **hybrid expert neuroscientist + philosopher** capable of providing integrated insights about human behavior. This addresses the gap where AI systems typically focus on either scientific or philosophical domains, but rarely combine them meaningfully.

The project demonstrates how RAG can create specialized domain experts by integrating cross-disciplinary knowledge sources to answer complex questions about human cognition, behavior, and the human condition.

## Problems Solved

### Integrated Knowledge Synthesis
- **Cross-domain connections**: Bridges cognitive neuroscience with philosophical wisdom
- **Contextual answers**: Provides evidence-based insights tempered by philosophical perspective
- **Thoughtful questioning**: Addresses "why" and "how to" rather than just "what"

### Production-Constraint Learning
- **Local inference**: Exposes real deployment challenges (performance, memory, accuracy trade-offs)
- **Resource awareness**: Forces consideration of model selection, quantization, and optimization
- **Practical engineering**: Teaches production-level decision making vs academic exercises

### Specialized AI Development
- **Domain expertise**: Shows how RAG enables specialized AI beyond generic assistants
- **Citation grounding**: Ensures answers are evidence-based and verifiable
- **Human behavior focus**: Specialized for questions like "Why do humans procrastinate?" vs general knowledge

## How It Works (User Experience)

1. **Data Preparation**: System processes Eagleman neuroscience + Stoic philosophy texts
2. **Intelligent Ingestion**: PDF extraction with reading order preservation and structure understanding
3. **Knowledge Integration**: Cross-reference neuroscience findings with philosophical perspectives
4. **Query Processing**: User asks questions about human behavior via HTTP API
5. **Synthethic Answer**: Returns integrated neuro-philosophy insights with citations

## User Experience Goals

- **Expert-Level Depth**: Answers integrate scientific accuracy with philosophical nuance
- **Citation Grounding**: Every claim supported by specific text references
- **Thoughtful Pace**: < 2 second responses encourage reflection rather than instant answers
- **Transparent Reasoning**: JSON output shows retrieved context and LLM reasoning
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates interdisciplinary AI capabilities

## Success Metrics
- **Answer Quality**: 80% of answers integrate both neuroscience and philosophy appropriately
- **Evidence Grounding**: All claims backed by specific text citations
- **Human Relevance**: Answers provide genuinely useful insights about human behavior
- **Performance Balance**: Maintains < 2 second response time on standard hardware
- **Learning Outcomes**: Repository demonstrates complete RAG pipeline mastery
