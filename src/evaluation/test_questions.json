Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens mediates the motivational aspects - the drive to obtain rewards, especially hedonically desirable ones ('wanting'). In contrast, the hedonic reaction to pleasure ('liking') is regulated by endogenous opioids and endocannabinoids acting via mu-type opioid receptors and CB1 receptors within the shell of the nucleus accumbens.

      "reference": "The thalamus plays a critical role in consciousness across multiple dimensions. Core consciousness depends on the functions of the brainstem and thalamus - it occurs when an organism is alive, awake, alert, and aware of the current moment. All sensory input except smell passes through the thalamus, which has neuronal connections forming loops with specific cortical regions that coordinate activity and contribute to consciousness. Attention, awareness, and consciousness all critically depend on the information-conveying capacity of the thalamus. The intralaminar nuclei provide diffuse input to large cortical areas; even small injury to these nuclei can produce profound reduction in consciousness. Consciousness arises from interactions between subcortical systems (brainstem, hypothalamus), the thalamus, and the cortex.",

Research using binocular rivalry (where perception alternates while physical stimulus stays constant) helps identify which neuronal properties correlate with consciousness changes. However, understanding WHY these correlates exist is the 'hard problem.' The problem of sentience - subjective experience, qualia, raw feelings, first-person viewpoint - remains elusive. While we can study self-knowledge and access to information scientifically, explaining how neural activity gives rise to subjective experience is fundamentally different. Currently we lack theoretical and operational tools to extrapolate subjective properties (consciousness) from properties of interconnected nerve cells. The hard problem lies at the outer limit of what material explanations will say about the experience of being human.",
