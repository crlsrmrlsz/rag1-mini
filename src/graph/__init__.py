"""GraphRAG module for knowledge graph construction and retrieval.

## RAG Theory: GraphRAG (arXiv:2404.16130)

GraphRAG augments RAG with knowledge graph structures for:
- Cross-document relationship discovery (entity linking)
- Hierarchical community detection (Leiden algorithm)
- Global query answering via community summaries

While vector search excels at local queries ("What does X say about Y?"),
GraphRAG enables global queries ("What are the main themes across all documents?").

## Module Structure

- schemas.py: Pydantic models for entities, relationships, communities
- extractor.py: LLM-based entity/relationship extraction
- neo4j_client.py: Neo4j connection and Cypher operations
- community.py: Leiden detection + community summarization
- hierarchy.py: Multi-level community parsing from Leiden
- centrality.py: PageRank computation for entity importance
- map_reduce.py: Async map-reduce for global queries
- query_entities.py: Query entity extraction (embedding + LLM)
- query.py: Graph retrieval strategy for hybrid search

## Data Flow

1. Section chunks → Entity extraction → Neo4j upload
2. Neo4j graph → Leiden communities → Community summaries (stored in Weaviate)
3. Query → Embedding/LLM entity extraction → Graph traversal → Chunk ID discovery
4. Vector search (Weaviate) + Fetch graph-only chunks → RRF merge → Answer
5. For global queries: Map-reduce over community summaries
