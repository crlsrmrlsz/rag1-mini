"""PageRank centrality computation for GraphRAG entity importance ranking.

## RAG Theory: Entity Importance in Communities

PageRank identifies "hub" entities that are well-connected to other
important entities. This is more informative than simple degree count
because it considers the quality of connections, not just quantity.

Used for:
1. Prioritizing entities in community summaries (top-k by PageRank)
2. Ordering members in generation context
3. Selecting representative entities for map-reduce

## Library Usage

Uses Neo4j GDS (Graph Data Science) library:
- gds.pageRank.stream() - Compute PageRank scores for all nodes
- gds.graph.project() - Create subgraph projection if needed

## Data Flow

1. After Leiden: Run PageRank on full graph projection
2. Store scores in Neo4j as `e.pagerank` property
3. Retrieve scores when building CommunityMember objects
4. Sort members by PageRank for summarization focus
