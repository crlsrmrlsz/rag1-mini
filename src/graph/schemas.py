"""Pydantic schemas for GraphRAG entities, relationships, and communities.

## RAG Theory: Knowledge Graph Data Model

GraphRAG represents extracted knowledge as a property graph:
- Nodes (entities): Named concepts with types (PERSON, CONCEPT, etc.)
- Edges (relationships): Typed connections between entities
- Communities: Clusters of related entities detected by Leiden

Using Pydantic models provides:
- Structured LLM output parsing (JSON Schema enforcement)
- Type validation at runtime
- Easy serialization for Neo4j and logging

## Library Usage

Pydantic v2 features used:
- model_validate_json(): Direct JSON string parsing
- model_json_schema(): Generate JSON Schema for LLM prompts
- Field(description=...): Self-documenting schemas for LLM guidance
